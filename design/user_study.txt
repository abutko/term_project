User study

- include animations for pieces moving (slide from oldPos to movePos)

- board flipping (keep two lists?)

- animations with timer fired / animation function

From this, I found the animations with moving the pieces was easy to implement. The board flipping, while nice, is not a necessary feature and complicates the current design involved in selecting board positions, so this idea was eliminated. 

Since the user study, I have made a nicer user interface which seeks to make the experience easier and more pleasant.
