CHESS in Python

3rd party libraries required - Python Imaging Library (PIL)

download for PIL is found at http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ with instructions (although there are many ways - I personally used Xcode with developer tools to install)

CHESS in Python is an application where the user can play two-player chess locally (that is, one computer controls both white and black) or against a computer player. It includes an option to save the current game to load later and to undo moves that the user has made.

All necessary images are included in the project directory.

All other modules used (pickle, Tkinter, os, subprocess) are default modules included with Python - all are imported within the script files and require no further action from the user.
